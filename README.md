# Frontend Architect ($1B-Grade UI Engine)
*Made by me and @Elric412

This skill constitutes an advanced system prompt or instruction protocol designed to elevate AI-generated frontend design far beyond standard UI patterns. It establishes an uncompromising standard for aesthetics, layout, interaction, and emotional resonance. The output is aimed at being on par with Awwwards Site of the Year (SOTY) quality.

## Core Philosophy: "No AI Slop"
The foundational premise of this skill is **distinctiveness**. It vehemently rejects anything generic, predictable, or templated. 

If 100 AIs would naturally converge on a design, that design is explicitly rejected. Output must emulate the high-end craft seen in elite agencies and leading global tech brands like Apple or Stripe, ensuring every pixel feels like it was designed with a specific human context and psychological purpose.

## Key Rules & Directives

### 1. The Anti-Slop Mandate
- **Banned:** Overused fonts (Inter, Roboto), cliched colors (purple/blue on white), 3-card+CTA layouts, standard linear easing, flat backgrounds, and generic placeholder text (Lorem Ipsum).
- **Mandatory:** Unexpected layouts, distinctive typefaces, atmospheric depth, and custom cubic-bezier animations.

### 2. Complete, Production-Ready Excellence
- All code must be delivered in **ONE continuous, complete block**.
- Placeholders and "add later" statements are forbidden. 
- Fully handle all states: Hover, Focus, Active, Disabled, Loading, Error, Empty.
- Semantic HTML and accessibility (keyboard navigation, high contrast ≥4.5:1) are baseline requirements.

### 3. Design System Pillars
* **Typography:** Display fonts must carry weight and presence (extended, bold). Body text must pair logically (e.g., contrasting sans and serif). Text is treated as visual architectural material, utilizing poster-scale layouts.
* **Color (4-Layer CSS Vars):** Palettes are derived directly from real-world inspirations (materials, nature, eras), ignoring abstract selections. Features an evolving depth hierarchy across 4 layers (Neutral depths, Accent behavior, Semantic brightness, Behavioral interaction).
* **Composition:** Prioritizes tension over comfort. Relies on staggered rhythms, asymmetry, overlapping panels, and strong eye-paths (Entry -> Anchor -> Destination).
* **Motion:** Animations are critical, functional narrative tools—not afterthoughts. Focus on fluid load choreography, scroll triggers, custom easing, and physical-simulated weight on every interactive element.
* **Responsiveness:** Code must be mobile-first with zero overflow or awkward text truncation, using fluid clamp() and unique structural redesigns per breakpoint, not just scaling.

## Execution Framework: LOCK & Output

Before code is ever generated, the system creates a **LOCK**—a binding structural and thematic contract:
1. **Context:** Target audience and tone.
2. **Aesthetic:** A defined visual direction (Brutalist, Luxury, Minimal, etc).
3. **Fusion:** A blend of ≥2 non-web domains (Architecture, Fashion, Cinema, etc).
4. **Palette & Type:** Specific real-world colors and display font combinations.
5. **Signature:** A recurring motif, and one central unforgettable moment.
6. **Subversion:** Taking an expected pattern and deliberately twisting it.

The final output sequence is always:
**`LOCK`** → **`MOTION MAP`** → **`COMPLETE WORKING CODE`**

## ⚡ PRIME MODE
The user can append the word **"Prime"** to their input to activate maximum output capability. This cranks all variables to absolute maximums:
* **Typography:** Type as literal architecture.
* **Color & Motion:** Cinematic choreography, behavioral reactive colors, 5+ signature motion pieces.
* **Innovation:** Advanced uses of generative SVG, shader-like CSS styling, and optical layout perfection.

## 🏢 SF MODE (Systematic Futurism)
An internal operational mode for **Tech UI Specialization** (SaaS, DevTools, Dashboards, Fintech). When activated (automatically or explicitly via `SF` or `SF Prime`), creativity transforms into **disciplined precision**. 

**Core Paradigm Shift:** 
* Spectacle → Trust
* Expression → Clarity
* Surprise → Comprehension
* Art Direction → Product Engineering

### SF Mode Overrides
* **Typography:** Neutrality preferred if it increases engineering clarity.
* **Color:** Accent usage is capped at ≤10% of the surface area. Guides action rather than dominating.
* **Composition:** Grid discipline over tension. Alignment and whitespace communicate system maturity.
* **Motion:** Strictly functional feedback (150–350ms duration). No cinematic choreography.
* **Innovation:** Expected patterns are improved upon; they are not shocked. Innovation must reduce cognitive load.

### SF LOCK Additions
* **Trust Axis:** Precision / Intelligence / Velocity / Security
* **System Density:** Focused / Balanced / Data-Heavy
* **Usage Context:** Daily Tool / Decision Dashboard / Onboarding / Analytics

## Verification Checklist (Multi-Lens Pass)
Every output undergoes an intensive verification across:
- **Psychological:** Cognitive load, layout delight.
- **Technical:** 60fps, GPU composited.
- **Accessible:** Screen reader & keyboard friendly.
- **Commercial:** Builds trust and converts.
